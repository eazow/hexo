>  What makes trading between rich countries difficult?


Chickens **slaughtered** in the United States, claim officials in Brussels, are not fit to grace European tables. No, say the American: our **fowl** are fine, we simply clean them in a different way. These days, it is differences in national regulations, far more than **tariffs**, that put sand in the wheels of trade between rich countries. It is not just farmers who are complaining. An electric **razor** that meets the European Union's safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States, and an American-made **dialysis** machine needs the EU's okay before is hits the market in Europe.


As it happens, a razor that is safe in Europe is unlikely to **electrocute** Americans. So, ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, why have two lots of tests where one would do? Politicians agree, in principle, so America and the EU have been trying to reach a deal which would **eliminate** the need to double-test many products. They hope to finish in time for a trade **summit** between America and the EU on May 28TH. Although **negotiators** are optimistic, the details are complex enough that they may be hard-pressed to get a deal at all.


Why? One difficulty is to construct the agreements. The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devices and then **hammer** out different **pacts** covering, say, electronic goods and drug manufacturing. The EU—following fine continental traditions—wants agreement on general principles, which could be applied to many types of products and perhaps extended to other countries.

These days, it is differences in national regulations, far more than tariffs, that put sand in the wheels of trade between rich countries. It is not just farmers who are complaining. An electric razor that meets the European Union's safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States, and an American-made dialysis machine needs the EU's okay before it hits the market in Europe.

**译文：**
布鲁塞尔的官员声称，在美国屠宰的鸡肉不适合摆上欧洲人的餐桌。美国人则反驳说：不对，我们的家禽很好，我们只是用不同的方式清洗它们而已。如今，阻碍富裕国家之间贸易的，与其说是关税，不如说是各国监管规定的差异。抱怨的不仅仅是农民。一个符合欧盟安全标准的电动剃须刀，在美国销售之前必须获得美国检测机构的批准；而一台美国制造的透析机，在进入欧洲市场之前也需要获得欧盟的许可。

**译文：**
事实上，在欧洲安全的剃须刀不太可能电死美国人。所以，问问大西洋两岸的企业，为什么要做两套测试，明明一套就够了？政治家们原则上同意，所以美国和欧盟一直在努力达成协议，以消除对许多产品进行双重测试的需要。他们希望在5月28日美国和欧盟贸易峰会之前完成谈判。尽管谈判代表持乐观态度，但细节足够复杂，他们可能很难达成任何协议。

**译文：**
为什么（谈判困难）？一个困难是如何构建协议。美国人乐意先就医疗器械标准达成一项协议，然后再分别敲定涵盖电子产品和药品制造等不同领域的协定。而欧盟——遵循优良的欧陆传统——希望就总体原则达成协议，这些原则可以适用于多种产品，并且或许还能扩展到其他国家。
