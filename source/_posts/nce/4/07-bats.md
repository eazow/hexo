> In what way does echo-location in bats play an **utilitarian** role?

Not all sounds made by animals serve as language, and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role.

To get a full appreciation of what this means we must turn first to some recent human inventions. Everyone knows that if he shouts in the **vicinity** of a wall or a mountainside, an echo will come back. The further off this solid obstruction, the longer time will elapse for the return of the echo. A sound made by tapping on the **hull** of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes, the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated. So was born the echo-sounding **apparatus**, now in general use in ships. Every solid object will reflect a sound, varying according to the size and nature of the object. A **shoal** of fish will do this. So it is a comparatively simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish. With experience, and with improved **apparatus**, it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but to tell if it is **herring**, **cod**, or other well-known fish, by the pattern of its echo.


It has been found that certain bats emit **squeaks** and by receiving the echoes, they can locate and **steer** clear of obstacles—or locate flying insects on which they feed. This echo-location in bats is often compared with radar, the principle of which is similar.

## **第一段重点句**

### 句子1️⃣
**原文：**
> Not all sounds made by animals serve as language, and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role.

**结构分析：**
```
主句1: Not all sounds ... serve as language
     (部分否定)

连接词: and

主句2: we have only to turn to ... to see ...
     (只需要...就能看到...)
     
定语从句: in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role
        (修饰 a case)
```

**逐词翻译：**
- **Not all** = 并非所有（部分否定，不是"所有都不"）
- **sounds made by animals** = 动物发出的声音
- **serve as** = 充当，作为
- **we have only to do sth** = 我们只需做某事
- **turn to** = 转向，查看
- **extraordinary discovery** = 非凡的发现
- **echo-location** = 回声定位
- **a case in which** = 一个...的例子
- **strictly utilitarian role** = 纯粹实用的角色

**参考译文：**
并非所有动物发出的声音都具有语言功能，我们只需看看蝙蝠回声定位这一非凡发现，就能明白声音在某些情况下纯粹起着实用性作用。

**翻译要点：**
- "Not all" 要译成"并非所有"，不能译成"所有都不"
- "have only to" 强调"只需要"的简单性
- "strictly utilitarian" 强调"纯粹的实用性"

**结构分析：**
```
主句: Everyone knows that...
宾语从句: if he shouts..., an echo will come back
         (条件状语从句 + 主句)
```

**逐词翻译：**
- **in the vicinity of** = 在...附近，在...邻近
- **mountainside** = 山坡，山腰
- **echo** = 回声
- **come back** = 返回

**参考译文：**
每个人都知道，如果在墙壁或山坡附近大喊，就会听到回声返回。

### 句子3️⃣ ⭐ **重点难句**
**原文：**
> A sound made by tapping on the hull of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes, the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated.

**结构分析：**
```
第一部分：
主语: A sound (made by tapping on the hull)
      [过去分词短语作定语]
谓语: will be reflected from...

第二部分：
方式状语: by measuring the time interval...
主语: the depth of the sea
谓语: can be calculated
```

**逐词翻译：**
- **tap on** = 敲击
- **hull** = 船体
- **be reflected from** = 从...反射回来
- **sea bottom** = 海底
- **measuring** = 测量
- **time interval** = 时间间隔
- **between A and B** = 在A和B之间
- **the receipt of the echoes** = 接收回声
- **at that point** = 在那个位置

**参考译文：**
敲击船体发出的声音会从海底反射回来，通过测量敲击声和接收回声之间的时间间隔，就可以计算出该处的海水深度。

**翻译技巧：**
- "made by tapping" 后置定语前置翻译："敲击...发出的"
- "by measuring" 方式状语提前更符合中文习惯
- "at that point" 译为"该处"更简洁

### 句子4️⃣
**原文：**
> So was born the echo-sounding apparatus, now in general use in ships.

**结构分析：**
```
倒装句: So was born the apparatus
正常语序: So the apparatus was born

插入语: now in general use in ships
       (现在在船上普遍使用)
```

**逐词翻译：**
- **So was born** = 于是...诞生了（倒装强调）
- **echo-sounding apparatus** = 回声测深仪
- **in general use** = 普遍使用，广泛应用
- **now** = 现在

**参考译文：**
回声测深仪就这样诞生了，现在已在船舶上普遍使用。

**语法点：**
- 倒装句用于强调"诞生"这个动作
- "now in general use" 是插入语，补充说明现状

### 句子5️⃣ ⭐ **重点难句**
**原文：**
> Every solid object will reflect a sound, varying according to the size and nature of the object.

**结构分析：**
```
主句: Every solid object will reflect a sound

现在分词短语作状语: varying according to...
                  (表示伴随情况)
```

**逐词翻译：**
- **solid object** = 固体物体
- **reflect** = 反射
- **varying** = 变化（现在分词）
- **according to** = 根据，按照
- **nature** = 性质，特性

**参考译文：**
每个固体物体都会反射声音，反射效果因物体的大小和性质而异。

**翻译技巧：**
- "varying according to" 直译是"根据...而变化"
- 意译为"因...而异"更地道

### 句子6️⃣
**原文：**
> So it is a comparatively simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish.

**结构分析：**
```
主语: it (形式主语)
真正主语: from locating... to locating...
         (从...到...)
```

**逐词翻译：**
- **comparatively** = 相对地，比较地
- **simple step** = 简单的一步
- **from A to B** = 从A到B
- **locate** = 定位
- **shoal of fish** = 鱼群

**参考译文：**
因此，从定位海底到定位鱼群，这是一个相对简单的进步。

### 句子7️⃣ ⭐ **最难句**
**原文：**
> With experience, and with improved apparatus, it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but to tell if it is herring, cod, or other well-known fish, by the pattern of its echo.

**结构分析：**
```
状语1: With experience
状语2: with improved apparatus
形式主语: it
真正主语: to locate... but to tell...
         (not only... but (also)... 结构)
方式状语: by the pattern of its echo
```

**逐词翻译：**
- **with experience** = 凭借经验
- **improved apparatus** = 改进的设备
- **it is possible to do** = 有可能做某事
- **not only... but (also)...** = 不仅...而且...
- **tell if** = 判断是否
- **by the pattern of** = 通过...的模式
- **echo** = 回声

**参考译文：**
凭借经验和改进的设备，现在不仅可以定位鱼群，还可以通过回声的模式来判断是鲱鱼、鳕鱼还是其他常见鱼类。

**翻译难点：**
1. 两个"with"状语的处理
2. "not only... but" 结构要完整体现
3. "by the pattern" 方式状语的位置调整

## **第三段重点句**

### 句子8️⃣
**原文：**
> It has been found that certain bats emit squeaks and by receiving the echoes, they can locate and steer clear of obstacles—or locate flying insects on which they feed.

**结构分析：**
```
主句: It has been found that...
宾语从句主干: bats emit squeaks and they can locate...
方式状语: by receiving the echoes
定语从句: on which they feed (修饰 insects)
```

**逐词翻译：**
- **it has been found that** = 已经发现（现在完成时被动）
- **certain bats** = 某些蝙蝠
- **emit** = 发出
- **squeaks** = 尖叫声，吱吱声
- **by receiving** = 通过接收

**参考译文：**
研究发现，某些蝙蝠会发出尖叫声，通过接收回声，它们可以定位并避开障碍物——或者定位它们捕食的飞行昆虫。

**翻译要点：**
- "It has been found" 可译为"研究发现"更自然
- 破折号表示补充说明
- "on which they feed" 译为"它们捕食的"

### 句子9️⃣
**原文：**
> This echo-location in bats is often compared with radar, the principle of which is similar.

**结构分析：**
```
主句: This echo-location is compared with radar
