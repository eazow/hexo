> How did Vera discover she had this gift of second sight?

Several cases have been reported in Russia recently of people who can read and detect colours with their fingers, and even see through solid doors and walls. One case concerns an eleven-year-old schoolgirl, Vera Petrova, who has normal **vision** but who can also **perceive** things with different parts of her skin, and through solid walls. This ability was first noticed by her father. One day she came into his office and happened to put her hand on the door of a locked safe. Suddenly she asked her father why he kept so many old newspapers locked away there, and even described the way they were done up in **bundles**.

Vera's curious talent was brought to the notice of a scientific research **institute** in the town of Ulyanovsk, near where she lives, and in April she was given a series of tests by a special commission of the **Ministry** of Health of the Russian Federal Republic. During these tests she was able to read a newspaper through an **opaque** screen and, stranger still, by moving her elbow over a child's game of Lotto she was able to describe the figures and colours printed on it; and, in another instance, wearing stockings and **slippers**, to make out with her foot the outlines and colours of a picture hidden under a **carpet**. Other experiments showed that her knees and shoulders had a similar sensitivity. During all these tests Vera was **blindfold**; and, indeed, except when blindfold she lacked the ability to perceive things with her skin. It was also found that although she could perceive things with her fingers this ability ceased the moment her hands were wet.

薇拉是如何发现自己拥有这种第二视觉天赋的？

最近在俄罗斯出现了几起关于人们能够用手指阅读和辨别颜色，甚至能透视坚固门墙的案例报告。其中一个案例涉及一名11岁的女学生薇拉·彼得洛娃，她拥有正常的视力，但同时也能用身体不同部位的皮肤感知事物，甚至能透过坚固的墙壁。这种能力最初是被她父亲发现的。有一天，她走进父亲的办公室，碰巧把手放在了一个上锁保险柜的门上。突然，她问父亲为什么要把这么多旧报纸锁在里面，甚至还描述了这些报纸是如何捆绑成束的。

薇拉这种奇特的天赋引起了她居住地附近乌里扬诺夫斯克市一家科学研究机构的注意。4月份，俄罗斯联邦共和国卫生部的一个特别委员会对她进行了一系列测试。在这些测试中，她能够透过不透明的屏幕阅读报纸；更奇怪的是，通过用肘部在儿童乐透游戏上移动，她能够描述印在上面的数字和颜色；在另一个实验中，她穿着袜子和拖鞋，用脚辨认出隐藏在地毯下面图片的轮廓和颜色。其他实验表明，她的膝盖和肩膀也有类似的敏感性。在所有这些测试中，薇拉都被蒙住了眼睛；实际上，除了蒙眼时，她缺乏用皮肤感知事物的能力。研究还发现，虽然她能用手指感知事物，但一旦手湿了，这种能力就会立即消失。
