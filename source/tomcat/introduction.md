Welcome to How Tomcat Works. This book dissects Tomcat 4.1.12 and 5.0.18 and
explains the internal workings of its free, open source, and most popular servlet
container code-named Catalina. Tomcat is a complex system, consisting of many
different components. Those who want to learn how Tomcat works often do know
where to start. What this book does is provide the big picture and then build a
simpler version of each component to make understanding that component easier.

Only after that will the real component be explained.
You should start by reading this Introduction as it explains the structure of the book
and gives you the brief outline of the applications built. The section "Preparing the
Prerequisite Software" gives you instructions on what software you need to download,
how to make a directory structure for your code, etc.
