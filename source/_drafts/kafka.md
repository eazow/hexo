### Introduction

#### [What is event streaming?](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_streaming)

Event streaming is the digital equivalent of the human body's central nervous system. It is the technological foundation for the 'always-on' world where businesses are increasingly software-defined and automated, and where the user of software is more software.

事件流是人体中枢神经系统的数字等效物。它是“永远在线”世界的技术基础，在这个世界中，企业越来越多地由软件定义和自动化，并且软件的用户更多地是软件。

Technically speaking, event streaming is the practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events; storing these event streams durably for later retrieval; manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively; and routing the event streams to different destination technologies as needed. Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time.

从技术上讲，事件流是从事件源（如数据库、传感器、移动设备、云服务和软件应用程序）以事件流的形式实时捕获数据的实践；持久存储这些事件流以供以后检索；实时和回顾性地操作、处理和响应事件流；并根据需要将事件流路由到不同的目标技术。因此，事件流确保了数据的连续流动和解释，以便正确的信息在正确的时间出现在正确的位置。



#### What can I use event streaming for?

Event streaming is applied to a [wide variety of use cases](https://kafka.apache.org/powered-by) across a plethora of industries and organizations. Its many examples include:

- To process payments and financial transactions in real-time, such as in stock exchanges, banks, and insurances.
- To track and monitor cars, trucks, fleets, and shipments in real-time, such as in logistics and the automotive industry.
- To continuously capture and analyze sensor data from IoT devices or other equipment, such as in factories and wind parks.
- To collect and immediately react to customer interactions and orders, such as in retail, the hotel and travel industry, and mobile applications.
- To monitor patients in hospital care and predict changes in condition to ensure timely treatment in emergencies.
- To connect, store, and make available data produced by different divisions of a company.
- To serve as the foundation for data platforms, event-driven architectures, and microservices.
